### Understanding the Needs of the Users

I would start by identifying key metrics that convey the performance/success of the
current checkout options. These would serve as a basis of comparison for this
'one-click checkout' feature. These metrics could include:

1. Conversion rate: The percentage of users that purchase a ticket after viewing an
   ad/event
2. What percentage of users end up not purchasing a ticket after adding it to their
   cart?
3. How much time it takes to make a purchase after adding a ticket to a cart?
4. User satisfaction: Can be asked via a survey to the user after completing a purchase

These metrics would help us understand and measure the key problems users face when
checking out. I would also look at the percentage of our active users that could use
from this feature. This question can be answered by looking at the percentage of users
that completed a successful purchase and also saved the payment method to their account.

### Understanding the Requirements

Assuming that I need to answer this question from the perspective of an analytics
engineer, I won't get into this aspect too much. The requirements could include:

1. Functional requirements: How is the ticket delivered after the purchase? What happens
   if multiple users try to check out with the same ticket? What happens if the payment
   fails?
2. Non-functional requirements: How fast should the checkout process be on average or
   most of the time (95th percentile)? What methods of payment should be supported?
   What level of scalability is needed for this feature (for example during peak hours).

### Data Collection Considerations for the Feature

I would lay out the types of event data that we would want to collect to measure
success. Having these identified before the implementation would allow the product team
to keep these in mind when designing the implementation. The event data that we would
want to collect could include:

1. If a user attempts to check out using this feature
2. If the checkout was a success
3. The time taken to complete the checkout
4. Type of payment method used
5. Value of the cart when this feature is used
6. Time of day when this feature is used (can be used for user analysis)
7. Type of event (I mean real life event here such as concerts, not to be confused with
   system events such as clicks :)) for which the ticket was purchased (can be used for
   user analysis)
8. (During A/B tests) If the user was prompted with the option to use this feature

### Launching the Feature

After the feature is implemented, I would suggest launching it with an A/B test. This
would allow us to measure the impact of the feature on the key metrics that we
identified. The way the A and B groups are split would be quite important for our
conclusions. So I would try to minimize the number of variables that could affect our
key metrics. For this purpose, I would suggest conducting A/B tests on multiple levels.
These could be the following:

1. Offering this feature to tickets of event A and not to tickets of event B where A and
   B are similar in terms of genre, popularity, price, etc. To determine this, we could
   look at events with a large overlap of users. Or, we could try to establish user
   similarity and use that.
2. Splitting the buyers of an event X into two groups A and B, one of which is offered
   this feature and the other is not. We need to make sure that these groups are
   balanced in terms of demographics, past purchase history, etc.

We also need to calculate the sample sizes needed to detect a significant difference in
the key metrics. This would help us determine how long the A/B test should run. After
the A/B test is complete, we would analyze the results and decide whether to launch the
feature to all users.

### Monitoring the Feature

After the feature is launched, we would need to monitor the key metrics that we
identified previously to see if there are system-wide changes to them. We would also
need to monitor the performance of the feature itself. This would include monitoring the
time taken to complete a checkout, the success rate of checkouts using this feature,
etc. We would also need to monitor the impact of the feature on other metrics. For
example, we would need to monitor the impact of this feature on the usage rate of other
checkout options and overall effect on user retention and satisfaction.

### Final Considerations

I should also note that it is important to keep in mind the current data infrastructure
TicketSwap has throughout these steps. For example, it could be that the current
infrastructure is not capable of tracking certain system events due to technical or
legal limitations. It could also be that my steps above would require changes to the
current infrastructure. These would need to be taken into account when planning.
