I would start out by identifying what analysis we want to conduct on this data. Below
are some information that I think is relevant for this data and TicketSwap:

- Locations:
    - Most popular locations, cities, and countries
    - Trending locations, cities, and countries
    - Stale locations (maybe the venue closed down) (can be estimated based on the date
      of last event held there)
- Events and Ads:
    - Most popular events
    - Trending events
    - Most popular artists (can be extracted from the event name)
    - Trending artists
    - Events for which we expect increasing traffic in the upcoming days, i.e. events
      that will happen soon
    - Amount of demand for the tickets of an event (is_sold ratio of the ads for this
      event)
    - Number of currently available tickets for an event
    - Average price per event, country, and city
    - The amount of deviation in the prices per event
    - What kind of people buy tickets for this event?
    - Is the same person selling a lot of tickets for this event?
    - How does the price affect the speed of selling the ticket?

Some of these questions cannot be answered by the data we have. Therefore, if possible,
I would supplement the data with another table that contains user information, i.e. the
buyers and sellers of tickets. The ad.csv file would then have pointers to this table
for the sellers as well as buyers if the `is_sold` column is set to 1.

Additionally, we need to supplement the ad.csv table with a column that shows the time
at which the tickets were sold if they were sold.

After looking at all the questions and the data, it seems to me that the original_price
column refers to the price at which an ad was created. This also means that we do not
store the price at which the original tickets of the event were sold, i.e. the price the
event organizer had set. This is important info, so I would add this as a column to the
event.csv table. With this info, we can limit the amount of deviation between the
original ticket price and the ad price. We can also calculate statistics like the amount
of deviation per country, etc. We could also calculate how the deviation affects the
speed or probability of selling a ticket. We can use this info to help sellers determine
the price of their tickets.

I assume that all tables are indexed by the `id` column. I would also index the ad.csv
table by the `event_id` column. I would index the event.csv table by the `location_id`.
Since we will be doing a lot of analysis based on these fields, indexing would make our
job easier by making the queries faster.
